# Task-Tracking Application

This is a simple README for a task-tracking application built using Java and Spring Boot. The project is a comprehensive guide to building a full-stack application.

## About the Project
This project is a back-end implementation of a task-tracking application. It focuses on using Spring Boot for building a robust and scalable API. The project also covers database integration with PostgreSQL, REST API endpoint implementation, and effective error handling.

## Key Features
* **RESTful API:** Provides a set of REST API endpoints for managing tasks and task lists.
* **Database Integration:** Connects to a PostgreSQL database for data persistence.
* **Dependency Management:** Uses Maven for simplified project management and dependency handling.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Includes mechanisms to handle and respond to errors gracefully.

## Getting Started
To get the back-end application up and running, follow the instructions provided in the video. The project requires:
* Java
* Maven
* Docker (for the PostgreSQL database)
* Spring Boot

The project's source code is available on the Devtrio community site. A React front-end is also available there for demonstration purposes.
